		defaults to current local timezone offset of the computer, but this can be
		changed by changing these variables before decoding.
		
		TODO:
		Ideally we'd like to offer people the ability to configure the used timezone
		by setting Decoder.Timezone and Encoder.Timezone; however, this is a bit
		tricky: the reason we use three different variables for this is to support
		round-tripping – without these specific TZ names we wouldn't know which
		format to use.
		
		There isn't a good way to encode this right now though, and passing this sort
		of information also ties in to various related issues such as string format
		encoding, encoding of comments, etc.
		
		So, for the time being, just put this in internal until we can write a good
		comprehensive API for doing all of this.
		
		The reason they're exported is because they're referred from in e.g.
