* Knowledge Graph
*
* This package provides a way of representing a knowledge graph with value nodes that represent the
* semantics of a value, and describes the operations that can be used to calculate the values.
*
* The Graph struct should have a lifecycle with two steps:
* 1. Creation: start by creating the object & instantiating its nodes.
* 2. Use: determining pathways through the graph should be done on a fixed graph.
