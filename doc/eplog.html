package log // import "github.com/epwr/better-science/internal/common/eplog"

log provides a structured logging solution that has the same basic interface as
slog, but is intended to be simpler (convention > configuration) and to output
jsonl lines to power GCP's logging system.

NOTE: currently, log can only handle the basic primitives as args to the log
functions. Check addArgs for a complete list of what is usable.

CONSTANTS

const (
	DEBUG    log_level = "DEBUG"
	INFO               = "INFO"
	WARN               = "WARN"
	ERROR              = "ERROR"
	CRITICAL           = "CRITICAL"
)

FUNCTIONS

func Critical(msg string, args ...any)
    Critical writes a message to the logs with a severity Level of CRITICAL.

    The first argument is a message string, and the remaining arguments should
    be an even numbered amount of values that represent key:value pairs (eg.
    args[0] is a key, args[1] is a value).

func Error(msg string, args ...any)
    Error writes a message to the logs with a severity Level of ERROR.

    The first argument is a message string, and the remaining arguments should
    be an even numbered amount of values that represent key:value pairs (eg.
    args[0] is a key, args[1] is a value).

func Info(msg string, args ...any)
    Info writes a message to the logs with a severity Level of INFO.

    The first argument is a message string, and the remaining arguments should
    be an even numbered amount of values that represent key:value pairs (eg.
    args[0] is a key, args[1] is a value).

func Warn(msg string, args ...any)
    Warn writes a message to the logs with a severity Level of WARN.

    The first argument is a message string, and the remaining arguments should
    be an even numbered amount of values that represent key:value pairs (eg.
    args[0] is a key, args[1] is a value).

func createBadKeyPair(argument any) (string, any)
    createBadKeyPair returns a key, value pair where the key is set to "!BADKEY"
    to match slog's behaviour.

func write_log_record(record log_record)
    write_log_record writes out the contents of a log_record to stdout.


TYPES

type code_location struct {
	Function string `json:"function"`
	File     string `json:"file"`
	Line     int    `json:"line"`
}
    code_location specifies a location in the code.

    NOTE: fields are exported so they can be encoded into JSON.

func get_location_of_caller() code_location
    get_location_of_caller returns the code_location (function name, file,
    and line number) of where this function's caller was called from (2 levels
    back down the call stack).

type log_level string

type log_record struct {
	Level   string         `json:"level"`
	Message string         `json:"message"`
	Caller  code_location  `json:"location"`
	Data    map[string]any `json:"data"`
}
    log_record stores the core information needed to write to the logs

    NOTE: fields are exported so they can be encoded into JSON.

func (r *log_record) addArgs(args ...any)
    addArgs parses the args list into a map, then sets the record's Data field
    to the map. It follows the behaviour of slog, in that:

    1. If an argument is a string and this is not the last argument, the
    following argument is treated as the value

    2. Otherwise, the argument is treated as a value with key "!BADKEY".
